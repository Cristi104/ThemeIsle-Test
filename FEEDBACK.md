## Feedback

### What was the most challenging part?

For me the most challenging part was creating the frontend of the app especialy doing so by using the SPA arhitecture, I have heard of it before but I haven't tried to actually use it until now.

### Which aspects of the application did you enjoy implementing?

I really enjoyed implementing the api endpoints and then making the connection to them in the frontend, it felt very nice to create an endpoin call it from the frontend and then try to debug it, tring to see whether the server, the client or both didn't work and then fixing it.

### Any suggestions for improvement?

I think that overall the test is good and it covers a big part of what a web developer needs to know, but a part that needs a bit of clarification is wheter the backend api should be a RESTful api or not, since in the implementation guidelines there is nothing about it but there are some links in the resources.
